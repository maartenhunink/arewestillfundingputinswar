# Are We Still Funding Putin's War?

This is the source code for [https://arewestillfundingputinswar.com/][1]

## Calculations

You can find the calculation for the total funds in assets/js/magic.js, it is based on an estimate of 950 million euro per day. This was calculated by [Simone Tagliapietra][2] from [Breugel.org][3]. You can find more info [here][4].

I would love to find detailed day to day data for oil and gas import and costs. Something similar to [this chart][5]. If you have access to this, please contact me.

## Help

If you can improve the calculations on this site, please donâ€™t hesitate to make changes to the source code or contact me.

Thank you!
